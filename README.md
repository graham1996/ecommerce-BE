# Ecommerce Back End

## Description
For this project we were tasked with using starter code to finish creating an application that simulates an ecommerce sites back end functionality, and that uses Express API and Sequelize to communicate with a MySQL database.
When the server is started, you can then use Insominia to view, create, update, and delete data in said database.
